## Why solar farm welding is one of the most critical trades in renewable energy construction

Utility-scale solar farms are built on steel.
Behind every solar panel array is a network of piles, torque tubes, racking systems, and structural supports that must withstand wind loads, soil movement, vibration, and decades of service life.

This is why **solar farm welding** has become one of the most essential services in renewable energy construction.

EPC contractors, civil crews, and utility teams rely on AWS-certified field welding to keep solar projects moving toward commissioning without costly delays or failed inspections.

Kings Mobile Welding is an AWS D1.1-certified solar welding subcontractor supporting EPC firms and utility infrastructure teams across Hampton Roads, Eastern Virginia, and the Mid-Atlantic.

## What is solar farm welding?

Solar farm welding refers to structural and field welding performed during the construction, modification, and maintenance of utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) facilities.

Typical solar welding scopes include:

- solar pile welding and splicing
- torque tube and racking repairs
- structural steel field welding
- bracket, plate, and gusset installation
- substation and utility steel repairs
- emergency welding for schedule-critical issues

On most solar sites, welding is not planned—it’s reactive.
When piles are misaligned, steel is damaged, or racking systems fail tolerance checks, contractors search for a **mobile welder near me** who can mobilize immediately.

## Solar pile welding: the structural foundation of solar farms

### Why pile welding is required on solar projects

Solar farms rely on driven steel piles or posts to support racking systems. Welding is often required when:

- piles must be spliced due to depth requirements
- piles are damaged during driving
- alignment corrections are needed
- brackets or connection plates must be added
- reinforcement is required due to engineering changes

These piles are structural elements. Improper welding can lead to:

- structural instability
- inspection failures
- long-term fatigue cracking
- corrosion and premature failure
- liability for EPCs and contractors

This is why most solar projects require welding performed under **AWS D1.1 structural welding standards**.

## Torque tube and racking system welding

Modern solar farms rely heavily on torque tubes and racking systems to support panel arrays. These systems are engineered to precise tolerances, but real-world site conditions often require field modifications.

Common torque tube and racking welding tasks include:

- crack repairs and reinforcement plates
- bracket replacement
- connection repairs
- misalignment corrections
- added tabs and plates
- field retrofits and modifications

According to our Solar Utility page, these are some of the most frequent reasons EPC teams call in field welders on solar projects.

## Structural steel welding on solar and utility sites

Solar farms are not just panel arrays—they often include utility infrastructure such as:

- substations
- equipment platforms
- steel frames and supports
- guards and mounts
- structural steel modifications

Field welding is required when:

- prefabricated steel does not align with site conditions
- equipment mounts must be modified
- structural supports require reinforcement
- damage occurs during installation or transport

Kings Mobile Welding provides structural steel field welding for platforms, embeds, supports, and jobsite modifications on solar and utility projects.

## AWS D1.1 and solar farm welding requirements

Most solar farm welding falls under **AWS D1.1 – Structural Steel Welding Code**.

For EPC contractors, this typically means:

- qualified Welding Procedure Specifications (WPS)
- certified welders
- inspection-ready workmanship
- adherence to project-specific specs
- documentation for QA/QC and closeout

Solar contractors often require subcontractors to provide:

- WPS and welder qualification records
- insurance and safety documentation
- inspection coordination (visual and NDT when required)
- QA/QC support during closeout

Kings Mobile Welding emphasizes an inspection-driven workflow: fit-up, prep, weld, and self-check aligned with project specifications.

## Why EPC contractors rely on mobile welding subcontractors

Utility-scale solar projects operate on tight commissioning schedules. Welding issues can create cascading delays across:

- pile driving crews
- racking installation teams
- electrical contractors
- commissioning timelines

A qualified mobile welding subcontractor provides:

- rapid mobilization
- structural code compliance
- coordination with site teams
- documentation-ready welds
- emergency response capability

Solar EPC teams often hire specialized field welders because failed welds or rework loops can delay energization and increase project costs.

## The hidden risk of poor welding on solar farms

Solar farms are designed to operate for 25–40 years. Substandard welding can result in:

- premature structural failure
- costly retrofits
- warranty disputes
- safety hazards
- reputational damage for EPCs and GCs

For contractors, investing in certified solar welding is not a cost—it’s risk mitigation.
