## AWS D1.5 Certified Bridge Welding — The VDOT Standard

VDOT bridge projects typically require welders qualified under **AWS D1.5 Bridge Welding Code**, which governs structural welding procedures, welder certifications, inspection criteria, and documentation requirements.

Kings Mobile Welding provides:

- AWS D1.5 certified bridge welders
- Field-ready mobile welding trucks
- Experience working alongside inspectors and engineer representatives
- Compliance with preheat, interpass temperature control, and weld procedure specifications

Because bridge welding often sits on the critical path of infrastructure projects, contractors rely on crews that understand DOT expectations and can mobilize quickly without sacrificing weld quality or safety.

## Bridge Erection Welding Services for VDOT Contractors

During bridge construction, welding plays a major role in maintaining structural integrity throughout installation. Kings Mobile Welding supports a wide range of erection-phase welding operations.

### H-Pile Tip Welding

Installation of heavy-duty H-pile tips requires consistent weld quality to withstand driving forces and long-term structural loads within bridge foundations.

### H-Pile Splice Welding

Field splice welding ensures continuity during pile driving operations. Our welders perform structural splice welds that meet AWS D1.5 requirements and engineer specifications.

### Carbon Arc Gouging for Full Penetration Pile Splice Welding

Many bridge pile splices require **complete joint penetration (CJP) welds**, which involve carbon arc gouging as part of the preparation process. Kings Mobile Welding performs controlled carbon arc gouging to:

- Create proper root openings for full penetration welds
- Back gouge splice joints to ensure complete fusion
- Remove backing material or defective weld metal
- Prepare connections for inspection-ready rewelding

Carbon arc gouging is a critical step in achieving full penetration welds that meet AWS D1.5 standards. Our mobile welding trucks are equipped with the air and power capacity needed to perform gouging operations safely and efficiently in the field.

### Sheet Pile Splice Welding

Sheet pile systems used for cofferdams and shoring require experienced welders who understand field tolerances and structural requirements.

### Pipe Pile Splice Welding

Pipe pile welding requires proper fit-up and structural welding technique to maintain load capacity in bridge foundations and marine environments.

### Pile Bracing and Structural Supports

We fabricate and weld pile bracing assemblies that stabilize bridge erection activities and support safe construction progress.

### Pile Caps, Bearing Pads, and Structural Attachments

Kings Mobile Welding assists contractors with pile caps, bearing pad welding, and structural modifications that keep erection workflows moving efficiently.

## Full Penetration Bridge Welding & Back Gouging Procedures (AWS D1.5)

Bridge welding often requires **full penetration groove welds** to ensure structural continuity under dynamic loading conditions. Achieving these welds may involve back gouging procedures to remove weld roots and allow welding from the opposite side of the joint.

Kings Mobile Welding performs full penetration welding procedures that support inspection readiness, including:

- Carbon arc back gouging for CJP weld preparation
- Joint preparation for UT or MT inspection requirements
- Controlled weld removal and rewelding when required by inspectors
- Structural welding procedures aligned with AWS D1.5 bridge standards
