Installing and maintaining billboard structures isn’t just about cranes and concrete — **the integrity of the entire sign depends on certified structural welding**. From monopole billboards to multi-post steel structures, every weld plays a critical role in safety, wind resistance, and long-term durability.

At **Kings Mobile Welding**, we specialize in **on-site billboard structure welding** performed by an **AWS-certified welder**, helping sign installation companies, general contractors, and property owners complete projects safely, efficiently, and in compliance with industry standards.

## Why Billboard Welding Is a Specialized Trade

Billboard structures are classified as **structural steel**, meaning the welding involved is far beyond cosmetic or light fabrication. These signs are exposed to:

- Constant wind loads
- Dynamic vibration
- Weather, corrosion, and UV exposure
- Public safety risk if a failure occurs

Because of this, billboard welding often involves:

- Structural fillet and groove welds
- Field splices on columns and catwalks
- Bracing, ladders, handrails, and maintenance platforms
- Repairs to existing structures after storm or vehicle damage

This is **not handyman welding** — it requires proper procedures, experience, and certification.

## AWS Certification Matters for Billboard Structures

Most billboard owners, sign companies, and municipalities **require AWS-certified welding** for structural work. That’s because AWS standards ensure:

- Proper weld size, penetration, and profile
- Compatibility with structural steel grades
- Compliance with engineered drawings
- Reduced liability for installers and owners

Kings Mobile Welding is **AWS D1.1 certified**, allowing us to weld **structural steel of unlimited thickness** — exactly what billboard structures demand.

## Mobile Welder Near Me: Why On-Site Welding Is Critical

Our mobile welding service allows us to:

- Support crane picks and steel erection schedules
- Perform field modifications when site conditions change
- Complete repairs without dismantling the structure
