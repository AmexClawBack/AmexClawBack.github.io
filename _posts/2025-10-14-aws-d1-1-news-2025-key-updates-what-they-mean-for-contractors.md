The **AWS D1.1 Structural Welding Code ‚Äì Steel** is the foundation of quality and compliance in structural welding across the United States. In April 2025, the **American Welding Society (AWS)** released the **D1.1 / D1.1M:2025** edition ‚Äî and it comes with major updates for fabricators, inspectors, and contractors alike.

At [**Kings Mobile Welding**](https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com), we‚Äôre proud to be **AWS D1.1 certified**, **fully insured**, and **OSHA 10 trained**, serving contractors and construction professionals throughout [**Hampton Roads VA**]() and surrounding regions.

This post explains what‚Äôs new in AWS D1.1:2025, how these changes affect your next project, and why working with certified welders like Kings Mobile Welding helps keep your operations compliant and efficient.

## üß± Major Updates in AWS D1.1:2025

### 1. New Prequalified Steel Grades

The 2025 edition adds **A913 Grade 80 (Gr80)** as a **prequalified base metal** ‚Äî the strongest currently permitted under D1.1. This reduces the need for additional WPS qualification for many high-strength applications.

Changes also include adjustments to **A913 Gr65** and **Gr70** preheat categories, expanding flexibility for engineers and welders.

### 2. Integration of LRFD Design Methods

Clause 4.7 introduces **Load & Resistance Factor Design (LRFD)** principles ‚Äî aligning the code more closely with modern structural design practice. Welders and engineers must ensure designs and procedures match the chosen method (ASD vs LRFD).

### 3. Clearer NDE & Inspection Requirements

The 2025 update refines **nondestructive testing (NDE)** criteria, magnetic particle (MT), and penetrant testing (PT) methods. These clarifications reduce ambiguity during inspections and align better with real-world practices.

### 4. Usability & Clause Reorganization

The code now features improved definitions, reorganized clauses, and clarified terminology. Many previously conflicting rules have been revised for better field interpretation and consistency.

## üåâ Related Code Updates

- **AWS D1.5M / D1.5:2025 (Bridge Welding Code)** ‚Äî Aligns with D1.1:2025 changes, especially ultrasonic inspection updates.
- **AWS D1.8 / D1.8M:2025 (Seismic Supplement)** ‚Äî Improves clarity for welds in seismic systems (SFRS).

Together, these codes strengthen compliance for contractors working in transportation, infrastructure, and structural steel sectors.

## üèóÔ∏è Why These Updates Matter for Contractors

- **Less Requalification = Lower Costs** ‚Äì Expanded prequalified materials reduce the need for WPS/PQR testing.
- **Stronger Design Options** ‚Äì High-strength steels like A913 Gr80 allow lighter, more efficient structures.
- **Simpler Inspections** ‚Äì Updated NDE language streamlines compliance and documentation.
- **Future-Proof Compliance** ‚Äì Many new projects now specifically reference AWS D1.1:2025, so staying current prevents rework and liability.
