If you do any work tied to roadways, bridges, traffic structures, or public infrastructure, you already know the biggest risk isn’t “can we weld it?”—it’s **will it pass inspection and stay compliant with DOT specs**.

This guide breaks down how **AWS D1.1** typically shows up on DOT jobs, when DOT work actually requires **bridge-specific code (AWS D1.5)**, and what documentation + execution standards are most often expected in the field.

## First: DOT welding isn’t “one code”

Most DOT projects are governed by a **stack** of requirements:

- **Contract documents** (plans/specs, special provisions, notes)
- **State DOT standard specs** (ex: VDOT specs for Virginia projects)
- **National references** (AASHTO specs and AWS structural welding codes)
- **Project QC/QA and inspection requirements**

On bridges and primary structural steel, DOT work commonly points to the **AASHTO/AWS Bridge Welding Code (AWS D1.5)** rather than AWS D1.1. The FHWA’s Bridge Welding Reference Manual specifically explains how highway structures rely on **AASHTO/AWS D1.5** and how it relates to **AWS D1.1**.

**Bottom line:**

- **AWS D1.1** is the general “structural steel” code used across many industries.
- **AWS D1.5** is the bridge-focused code used for welded bridges/components designed to AASHTO/AREMA requirements.

And at the federal level, FHWA regulations list standards that include **AASHTO/AWS D1.5** and **AWS D1.4 (rebar)** among the recognized references for highway-related standards.

## Where AWS D1.1 shows up on DOT projects

Even when the project is “DOT,” **not everything is bridge code**. AWS D1.1 is commonly used for:

- **Highway-related structural steel that is not part of a bridge superstructure** (project-specific—always verify)
- **Miscellaneous steel** packages on DOT jobs
- **Temporary works** and support frames (if allowed by specs)
- **Field modifications/repairs** to structural items that are governed by D1.1 in the contract
- **Fabrication or site welding** on structures that fall under general structural steel requirements

Also, DOT work often involves **other AWS codes** depending on the material:

- **AWS D1.4** is used for **reinforcing steel** welding when permitted by the design/specs.

## When it’s NOT AWS D1.1: bridge work often triggers AWS D1.5

If you’re welding on:

- bridge girders / bridge components
- bridge splices
- structural bridge repairs governed by bridge specs
- bridge fabrication requirements called out in DOT documents

…you’ll very often be under **AWS D1.5**, not D1.1. DOT training/inspection materials commonly reference **AASHTO/AWS D1.5** for bridge welding conformance.

**Tip:** The fastest way to get burned on DOT work is assuming “AWS D1.1 certified” automatically equals “bridge compliant.” D1.1 is a big deal—**but bridge specs can be different** (procedures, acceptance criteria, inspector expectations, etc.).

## The DOT inspection mindset: “Show me the paperwork, then show me the weld”

On DOT jobs, the weld itself is only half the battle. The other half is proving you had control of:

### 1) Welding procedures: WPS (and sometimes PQR)

A **WPS (Welding Procedure Specification)** is the document the welder follows to produce code-compliant welds.

In AWS D1.1, many contractors use **prequalified WPS** (when the joint details, process, base metal group, filler, etc. meet the code’s prequalification limits). If you don’t meet prequal rules, you typically need procedure qualification testing (a **PQR**) to prove the procedure works.

**What inspectors/GCs commonly want on DOT work:**

- The WPS on site (current revision, signed, legible)
- Proof the procedure is prequalified **or** qualified by testing (as required)

### 2) Welder performance qualification (WPQ)

Even with a solid WPS, DOT/GCs will typically require proof the welder is qualified for:

- the process (SMAW/FCAW/GMAW, etc.)
- the position (1G/2G/3G/4G…)
- the joint type and thickness range (per code/spec)

### 3) Material and filler control

Expect attention to:

- base metal identification (including coatings like galvanizing, when applicable)
- electrode/filler classification and storage/conditioning as required by project specs
- preheat/interpass requirements as written in the WPS (and sometimes contract notes)

### 4) Inspection + acceptance criteria

DOT work frequently requires a documented inspection pathway (visual inspection always, and NDT when specified). The “acceptance” criteria will be whatever the contract cites (D1.1 vs D1.5 vs special provisions).

## What “AWS D1.1 explained” means in the field (plain English)

Here’s the practical way to think about AWS D1.1 on real jobs:

- **D1.1 tells you how to make structural welds** that are acceptable under the code (procedures, qualification, workmanship, inspection).
- **You still have to follow the job’s drawings and spec notes** (D1.1 doesn’t override project requirements).
- **Your WPS is the rulebook your welder actually follows** on the jobsite. If you can’t produce it, you’re immediately on defense.
- **Prequalified WPS saves time**—but only if your joint/process variables stay inside the prequalification limits.

## DOT contractor checklist: what to have ready before you mobilize

If you want to look “inspection-ready” (and win more DOT-related work), show up with:

- **WPS packet** (project-relevant procedures)
- **Welder qualifications** (WPQ continuity if required)
- **Calibration/condition evidence** when applicable (machines, ovens, etc. per project)
- **COI + safety docs** (GC onboarding requirements)
- **Jobsite execution plan** (access, traffic control coordination if needed, lift plan if required)
- **NDT coordination plan** if the contract calls for MT/PT/UT/RT

## Common DOT welding scenarios (and what usually matters most)

### Field splices / structural modifications

- Correct joint prep and fit-up
- WPS matches the joint and position
- Heat input/preheat control (per WPS/spec)
- Visual acceptance + NDT if required

### Galvanized or coated steel repairs

- Coating removal in weld zone (per spec and good practice)
- Fume control and PPE
- Repair coating requirements after weld (often governed by project coating spec, not welding code)

### Rebar welding (when allowed)

- Often governed by **AWS D1.4** (not D1.1).
- Many DOT designs restrict rebar welding except for approved details—always verify.

## Why primes and GCs care: risk, schedule, and closeout

DOT jobs are schedule-driven and paper-driven. A single failed weld or missing document can cause:

- repair cycles
- inspector hold points
- delays to subsequent trades
- payment delays during closeout

Our goal is simple: show up prepared, coordinate cleanly, and deliver welds that pass the first time—especially on infrastructure scopes where downtime is expensive.

## FAQ: DOT welding requirements (quick answers)

**Is AWS D1.1 the DOT welding code?**
Sometimes—but many bridge-related scopes are governed by **AWS D1.5** (bridge welding code) and DOT specs may also invoke other standards depending on the item.

**What’s the main difference between D1.1 and D1.5?**
D1.1 is the general structural steel code; D1.5 is specifically written for **welded bridges and bridge components** designed to AASHTO/AREMA requirements.

**Do I need a WPS on site for DOT work?**
In practice, yes—GCs/inspectors commonly expect the WPS and welder qualifications to be available, especially on structural scopes.
