Commercial renovations move fast—tight deadlines, limited access, occupied buildings, and constant coordination between trades. In all that controlled chaos, **welding becomes one of the most important yet most overlooked parts of a successful commercial build-out.**

As a mobile, AWS-certified field welding contractor serving Hampton Roads and the Mid-Atlantic, Kings Mobile Welding regularly gets called in to fix issues that _should have been handled earlier_ in the project. When they’re missed, they create delays, failed inspections, or costly last-minute modifications.

Below are the **Top 10 Welding Tasks Commercial Contractors Commonly Overlook During Renovations**—and how handling them early keeps your project moving smoothly.

## **1. Joist Reinforcement for New Rooftop Units & Mechanical Upgrades**

Most commercial build-outs involve mechanical modifications—RTUs, ductwork, new HVAC platforms, and penetrations.
What many contractors miss is the **engineering requirement for joist reinforcement** when new loads are introduced.

Missing this step can cause:

- Failed inspections
- Last-minute steel procurement
- Schedule delays for the mechanical contractor

Kings Mobile Welding fabricates and installs reinforcement angles, stiffeners, bridging, and load-rated supports directly on site—_often in a single mobilization_.

## **2. Structural Steel Modifications Hidden Behind Walls & Ceilings**

Once ceilings come down, it’s common to discover:

- Cut or damaged steel
- Old, unsupported equipment
- Rusted connections
- Missing bracing or hangers

Contractors often underestimate how much welding is needed once the structure is exposed. We provide **on-demand structural repair, bracing fabrication, and reinforcement** during demo and rough-in.

## **3. RTU Frames, Platforms, and Roof Steel Repairs**

Rooftop renovations bring a whole list of welding needs that GCs don’t expect until they’re already on the roof:

- RTU frame fabrication
- Platform supports
- Railings & equipment guards
- Curb reinforcement
- Spot repairs on rusted steel

We fabricate custom frames and weld them in place, ensuring the mechanical install stays on track.

## **4. Roof Access Ladder Installations & Ladder Reinforcement** _(Most Commonly Overlooked)_

Commercial renovation teams often forget that **new rooftop units and tenant improvements require code-compliant roof access**, including:

- Fixed steel ladders
- Landing platforms
- Ladder brackets
- Cage systems
- Wall mounting reinforcements
- Safety grab rails

We install, modify, or reinforce fixed roof ladders to meet **Virginia Building Code** and OSHA clearance requirements—eliminating inspection issues before they appear and ensuring your client has safe, permanent access to rooftop equipment.

## **5. Safety Rails, Guardrails, and Fall Protection Anchor Welding**

During renovations, safety rails often must be:

- Cut and reinstalled
- Extended to new locations
- Welded to new structural points
- Repaired or fabricated on the spot

These are among the most common last-minute calls we get—especially when inspections are the next morning.

## **6. Heavy Equipment & Building Support Repairs**

From forklifts to scissor lifts to material handling equipment, contractors frequently need:

- Fork pockets repaired
- Broken brackets fixed
- Bumper stops welded
- Custom supports fabricated
- Dock plate repairs

We provide rapid onsite repairs that keep the project—and the equipment—moving.

## **7. Beam Seat & Column Plate Additions During Layout Changes**

When walls move, storefronts shift, or rooms are reconfigured, steel must often be added to support:

- New openings
- Door frames
- New load paths
- Dropped ceilings
- HVAC and electrical trays

GCs often overlook this until framing is already underway. We fabricate and weld plates, angles, and supports directly on site.

## **8. Mezzanine & Catwalk Modifications During Office/Retail Fit-Outs**

Renovations in industrial and commercial facilities often require:

- Mezzanine modifications
- Catwalk repairs
- New stair brackets
- Landing reinforcements
- Steel grating welding

We frequently support tenant improvements needing quick adjustments to mezzanine structures—keeping the GC’s schedule intact.

## **9. Steel Plate Installation on Damaged or Weak Concrete**

During interior build-outs, contractors discover damaged concrete areas around:

- Door thresholds
- Equipment pads
- Rail bases
- Column bases
- Penetration cutouts

Installing **¼″ or ⅜″ steel plates** with welded anchors is one of the fastest ways to add structural integrity without major demolition.

## **10. Custom Brackets, Supports, and Field Fabrication for “One-Off” Issues**

Every renovation has _that one thing_ no one accounted for:

- A pipe that needs a bracket
- A beam that needs a tab
- A wall that needs a reinforcement plate
- A canopy that needs new legs
- A frame that doesn’t fit as designed

Instead of delaying the job waiting on a shop, Kings Mobile Welding fabricates whatever you need **right on site**.
