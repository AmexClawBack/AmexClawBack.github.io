## Residential Structural Steel Support

### 1) Load-Bearing Headers & Wide-Span Beams

Open-concept remodels, basement finishing, and garage lifts often require **steel I-beams or flitch plates** to carry long spans.
We weld:

- **Header-to-column plates** for wall removals
- **Beam splices** where steel must be set in sections
- **Bearing stiffeners, hangers, and plates** for load transfer
- **Angle or tube headers** integrated with LVL or wood framing

Kings Mobile Welding supplies and welds these components on site, ensuring each connection meets engineering load requirements and inspector expectations.

### 2) Residential Steel Fabrication & Custom Frames

We also build and weld:

- **Porch and deck supports**
- **Basement and garage column bases**
- **Canopy or awning frames**
- **Custom stair stringers and handrails**

### 3) Structural Repairs & Retrofits

Cracked welds, sagging beams, or corroded posts can often be repaired instead of replaced.
We add **flitch plates, stiffeners, and bearing plates** to restore integrity and save homeowners costly tear-outs.

## Built Around Inspection & Safety

Every weld is laid out with **clear access, cleanup, and inspector hold points**.
We coordinate visual and non-destructive testing (VT / PT / MT / UT / RT) when required, and document all work for record sets.
