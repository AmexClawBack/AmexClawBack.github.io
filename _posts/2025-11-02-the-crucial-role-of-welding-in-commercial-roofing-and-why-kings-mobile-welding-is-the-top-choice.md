When it comes to commercial roofing, the structure isn’t just what you see on the surface. Membrane, shingles, coatings — none of that matters unless the STEEL structure underneath is solid, supported, properly welded, and built to hold up to commercial loads and rooftop equipment.

This is where welders come in.

### What Role Does Welding Play in Commercial Roofing?

Commercial roofs rely on steel: bar joists, beams, deck panels, roof support steel, mechanical support, rooftop unit curbs, and more.

Welders support roofing contractors by:

- welding structural bar joists in place on-site
- welding bridging for joist stabilization
- modifying steel to correct fit-up issues
- welding/adding support steel for RTUs
- torch-cutting penetrations cleanly for mechanical/electrical
- fabricating and installing new curb structures for equipment tie-ins

For example, Kings Mobile Welding provides dedicated services for these exact needs:

- [Bar Joist Welding](https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com/services/structural/bar-joist-welding/)
- [RTU Curb Fabrication & Welding](https://www.kingsmobilewelding.com/services/structural/rtu-curb-fabrication-welding/)

These services are critical in commercial roof environments because bad welds = future problems (leaks, sagging, structural failure risk, equipment support issues, and expensive callbacks).
